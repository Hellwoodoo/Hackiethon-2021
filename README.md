Hackiethon 2021 project!!

Made with ReactJS, involving a timer and proxy to DuckDuckGo API and other APIs!

For this year's Hackathon theme <Working from Home>, our team knew that one common issue facing both students and workers is productivity, so we decided to try to solve it using the Pomodoro Technique. This is a time management technique where people fully focus on their work for 25 minutes then take a short 3 to 5 minute break to recharge and repeat until the work is done. For our project we used a website to replicate the technique and used the DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API and other APIs to return multiple search results to serve as entertainment during the break.
